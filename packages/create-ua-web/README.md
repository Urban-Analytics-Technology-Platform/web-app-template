# create-ua-web

Node package which sets up (in a new directory) a web template.

## Run locally

`cd` to this directory (`packages/create-ua-web`), then

    npm exec .

## In the future, you can do:

    npm create ua-web@latest

(Although we have to publish this package to the npm registry first.)
