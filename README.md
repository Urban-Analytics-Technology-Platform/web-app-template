# UA web template

This repo contains 

- A set of svelte components for building urban analytics applications
- An app template for getting started with these applications

There are some pnpm commands for making it easier to work with both 

```
    pnpm build_components # Build the component library
    pnpm dev_components # Run the component dev server
    pnpm dev_app  # Run the app template
```

Components should live in the ua-components/src/lib/components directory
